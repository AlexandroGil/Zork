This Game simple text based game is call "LOST IN THE FOREST", you must find a way to exit the dark forest
This game divides into 2 modes of playing, one is explore the map and pick up items, and the other is a turn based dialogue chat, the
only way to access the second one is to encounter the Farmer, beware where you encounter him!

The farmer moves through the whole map randomly and it moves every - time passes

## Personal Opnion
This game was a bit difficult to make because mostly time, just 3 days to be able to get a quick response on it and also the dialogue system was a bit hard to set with setting up a json first, but that was because of time also.
